custom flavors allows for the creation of custom serilization and deserilization logic for model packaging and deployment

custom pthon models in mlflow empower data scientists to incorporate their own algorithms, custom logic and external libraries seamlessly into the model building process.





Custom Flavor
1.serialiation adn deserilization logic: convert model to a serilized format.
2.Create flavor directory structure: create a dir structure containing the necesary files and metadata required for serialization, deserilization and serving of the model
3. register the custom flavor: register the custom flavor by creating a subdirectory within the mlflow/models/directory and placing the flavor files in that subdirectory
4.Define flavor specific tools and functions
